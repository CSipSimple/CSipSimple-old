This package provides a library that adds ZRTP support to the GNU
ccRTP stack. Phil Zimmermann developed ZRTP to allow ad-hoc, easy to
use key negotiation to setup Secure RTP (SRTP) sessions. GNU ZRTP
together with GNU ccRTP (1.5.0 or later) provides a ZRTP
implementation that can be directly embedded into client and server
applications.

The GNU ZRTP implementation is compliant to the basic functions of
ZRTP as described in ''draft-zimmermann-avt-zrtp-08x''. Currently GNU
ZRTP supports the basic features and multi-stream mode , not the enhanced
features like PBX SAS relay or preshared mode. The GNU ZRTP implementation
already defines the necessary external interfaces and functions for
these enhanced features but they are not yet implemented (stubs only).

You may access the ZRTP specification at this URL:

The first application to demonstrate this capability was the 0.8.2 release 
of the Twinkle softphone client. All following versions of Twinkle support
GNU ZRTP as well.
